/*You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either -1 or an empty value like None or null, depending on your language. You may assume the argument is non-negative.*/
function findNextSquare(sq) {
    if (Math.sqrt(sq) !== Math.trunc(Math.sqrt(sq))) {
      return -1;
    } else {
      return (Math.sqrt(sq)+1)**2;
    }
